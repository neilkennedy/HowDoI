#Everything I'm trying to learn at the moment

This is just a bloated repo of different libraries and technologies I'm currently trying to learn.

If this grows to a stupidly large size I'll probably break it out into different sub repos.

Currently I'm working on [Kendo UI](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui), [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/), [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) and some SQL Server GeoSpatial stuff so expect to see those things in here.

#OpenLayers Legend

###This is a simple OpenLayers custom legend control. 

The control is created using [OpenLayers.Control.Panel](http://dev.openlayers.org/releases/OpenLayers-2.13.1/doc/apidocs/files/OpenLayers/Control/Panel-js.html) and some custom markup and CSS. This was created for a project I'm currently working on using OpenLayers to toggle on and off different layers on the map. 

You'll need to attach your own click event to the checkboxes and write OpenLayers code to toggle the layers visiblity, I'm assume you'll all know how to do that if you've come this far... go you!
